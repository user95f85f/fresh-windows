strongly recommended things to do with a fresh cygwin & get:
1) lynx (to connect to google.com to search safely)
        (to connect to youtube.com to search safely)
2) nano (because why not)
3) perl/php/python2/python3 (EG. to get youtube-dl running and
   have a web server running on port 8080)
4) vim/vim-doc (to quickly edit files)
5) wget (a great way to download files from the Internet)

for games I recommend:
1) steam (for team fortress 2, counter strike: global offensive, et al)
2) battle.net (for diablo 3)

for a text editor I recommend getting Notepads App from the Windows Store
then to launch Notepads App you just go Win+R to run and then "notepads"

I recommend for high DPI systems to use Win++ to zoom in and Win+- to zoom out
